## Setting Up the Development Environment with Docker

We use Docker and Docker Compose to simplify the setup of the development environment. This allows you to run the application and all its associated services in containers without having to install any additional dependencies on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t-rosa/www.gustopizza.com.git
cd www.gustopizza.com
```

2. (optional) Intialize git flow

- [Install Gitflow CLI](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/)
- [Workflow guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

```bash
git flow init
```

Use the default branch name options (main, develop, feature/,etc)

3. Launch the application and associated services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose build && docker compose up
```

This command will build the Docker images, create and start the containers for the application and the database. The application files are shared between your local machine and the container using bind mounts, enabling real-time development.

4. Run Prisma migration

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

5. Access the application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Remote development process

1. Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Modify the `.env` file by adding your own values for the environment variables if necessary.

2. Use [Visual Studio Code dev containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) to attach directly to the running container

3. Start developing by following the workflow

- [Workflow guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

### Local development process

1. Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. install local dependencies to remove lint error and launch your IDE locally

```bash
sudo chmod 777 -R node_modules && npm i
```

3. Start developing by following the workflow

- [Workflow guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)

### Useful Commands

- Running tests

```bash
docker compose run test
```

- Add a new dependency

```bash
docker exec web npm install <package_name>
```

- Stop containers and remove associated resources:

```bash
docker compose down
```

- Restart a specific service (e.g., `web`):

```bash
docker compose restart web
```

- Execute commands inside a specific container (e.g., `web`):

```bash
docker compose exec web <command>
```

Replace `<command>` with the command you want to execute inside the container.

- Show logs:

```bash
docker compose logs <container-name>
```
